# **med.voll.api**

## **About the project**

### **Med.voll.api** is a RESTful API developed during a Java and Spring Boot training course provided by Alura, the largest tech platform in Brazil. This project aims to build the backend for a fictional medical clinic. Within this framework, the clinic would utilize the application to manage the registration of doctors and patients as well as the scheduling and cancellation of appointments.

## **Objectives of the Initial Phase**

+ **Development:** Craft a Java-based REST API utilizing Spring Boot from the ground up.
+ **CRUD Operations:** Implement Create, Read, Update, and Delete functionalities with a MySQL database backend.
+ **Database Migrations:** Incorporate Flyway for seamless API database migrations.
+ **Data Validation:** Utilize Bean Validation to ensure data integrity and correctness.
+ **Data Management:** Introduce pagination and sorting capabilities for efficient data handling in the API.

## **Technologies Deployed**

+ **Framework:** Spring Boot 3s
+ **Programming Language:** Java 17
+ **Code Simplification:** Lombok
+ **Database & Migrations:** MySQL with Flyway
+ **ORM:** JPA and Hibernate
+ **Project Management:** Maven
